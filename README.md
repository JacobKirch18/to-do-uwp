# To-Do UWP Application

## A basic To-Do Application made in Universal Windows Platform

### Features the ability to set tasks with due dates, mark them as complete, and view completed tasks. Also featuring poorly drawn cat logos because I am not a graphic designer.

Dev note:

Yes, I know the trope of computer science students making to-do apps, but I did not make this to be an impressive feat of software engineering. I was simply tired of using notepad as a to-do list and I was bored.
